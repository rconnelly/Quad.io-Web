#### Founded by Craftsmen  ####
We founded Quad.io with the goal of building a **software company** focused on building great software products.
Whether we are building applications for clients or our own customers, we engineer **stable,
secure, and testable code**. In a world of mass-produced, careless code, we are proud software craftsmen
who put **quality above all else**.

#### Quality and Value ####
There is an old software adage: _**Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick Two**_. We build quality software efficiently. We use the agile
methodology to help stay efficient and track metrics of our teams. We focus on good, just-in-time up app design.
We build software by concentrating on only the most important features and prioritizing based on actual customer feedback.
We help our clients balance the end user needs with their business needs.


#### ROWE - Results Only Work Environment ####
Our people are what make us great. Without the hard work of engineers, managers, support, and qa, we couldn't be
successful. Having the right talent is critical to any business. But often attracting and retaining top quality people
can be really difficult.

That's why we are a **Results Only Work Environment (ROWE)**. We are really picky about who we hire, and when we interview
candidates must be self-driven, motivated individuals who want to succeed and don't need a lot of hand holding. We don't have
core hours. We don't have a requirement to be in the office. Instead, we set very high expectations and judge people not on
how much they work or where they work, but **what they accomplish**.

We give employees back their time, and in return, they take the responsibility the company's success.
