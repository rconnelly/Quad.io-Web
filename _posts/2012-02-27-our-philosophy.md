#### Founded by Craftsman         {#craftsman)
We founded Quad.io with the goal of building a **software company** focused on delivery value to businesses and
consumers. Whether we are building applications for clients or our own customers, we focus on **engineering stable,
secure, and testable code**. In a world of mass-produced, careless code, we are proud craftsman who put **quality above all
else**.

#### Quality and Value         {#quality-value)
There is an old software adage: _**Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick Two**_. We fall in the world of Good and Fast. We use the agile
methodology to help stay efficient and track metrics. We focus on good, just-in-time up front design. By focusing on
what the most important features, we deliver the best value. We do this by listening to our customers and clients and
and balance our end user needs with business value. We help companies discern what features are really important in a
product and which are just nice to have.


#### ROWE - Results Only Work Environment        {#rowe)
Our people are what make us great. Without the hard work of engineers, managers, support, and qa, we couldn't be
successful. Having the right talent is critical to any business. But often attracting and retaining top quality people
can be really difficult.

That's why we are a **Results Only Work Environment (ROWE)**. We are really picky about who we hire. When we bring someone
we hire self-driven, motivated individuals who want to succeed and don't need a lot of hand holding. We don't have
core hours. We don't have a requirement to be in the office. Instead, we set very high expectations and judge people not on
how much they work or where they work, but **what they accomplish**.

We give employees back their time, and in return, they take the responsiblity for success. <a href="/team">Find out more about our team</a>.
