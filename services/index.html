                        We write unit tests for all of our code. We use automated UI testing as well. However, there is
                        no real substitute for humans when testing an application. We can provide these service on top of
                        our software engineering services.

                        We have two types of service agreements: <strong>Hourly and Subscription</strong>.
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Hourly Rate</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        This is our standard agreement; we bill by the
                        hour based on a set rate. We handle project management and scheduling of releases. The client decides on
                        the features with our help, and then we deliver code. These agreements are strictly time and material
                        projects.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <strong>Monthly Subscription</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Some companies prefer to go with a "subscription model". Rather than worrying about "hours",
                        our clients worry about "results". We agree to a set of features for a month (called it
                        a sprint) and hit that date. Basically, you pay for the sprint rather than the hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What this means is that you now pay for "features" rather than "hours". It helps with business
                        decision making. This lets companies decide if the development is "really worth X amount of
                        dollars"?
